        <p class="footer">* Available for Qualified Purchasers only. Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple Gift Card
            when they purchase an Eligible Product at a Qualifying Location through September 30, 2024. Gift card values
            may vary by Eligible Product. Only one Apple Gift Card per Eligible Product per Qualified Purchaser. Offer
            subject to availability. While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the
            value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in
            their cart, including the Apple Gift Card. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly
            statement for Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers
            selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as payment type at checkout shall
            receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product. This
            will result in one ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant
            credit, and a second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the Apple Gift Card. The
            total combined amount charged over the two separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full
            retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the
            Apple Gift Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the Eligible Product. Apple Card Monthly
            Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you select it at checkout in the
            U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling
            1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for
            more information about eligible products. APR ranges may vary based on when you accepted an Apple Card.
            Cardholders who accept an Apple Card on and or after February 1, 2024: Variable APRs for Apple Card, other
            than ACMI, range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of February 1, 2024. Existing
            cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy an ACMI-eligible product
            by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple
            Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0%
            APR. When you buy an iPhone with ACMI, you‚Äôll need to select AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when
            you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time.
            ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase
            Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and
            Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices. The last month‚Äôs payment for each
            product will be the product‚Äôs purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI
            financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to installment term
            lengths and eligible products. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for information about upcoming changes to
            ACMI financing. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement for more information about ACMI financing. Apple Card
